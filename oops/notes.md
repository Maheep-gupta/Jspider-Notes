# OOPS
## Pre-conditions for class and Objects
1. Variables
2. Functions

## Pre-conditions for OOPS:
1. Class
   1. static members
   2. non-static members
2. Objects

## OOPS Principals
1. Encapsulation
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism
4. Abstraction
5. Generalization
6. Specialization 
7. Standardization
8. Composition
9. Aggregation 
10. Realization

# Introduction to class and Objects
- In a java Source file we can define multiple class structure, the class may contain main method or may not contain the main method , the compiler generates separate .class file for each class structure add t=ing the execution
- the class which contains the main method is eligible for execution, the class without main method is not eligible for beginning the execution.

### Program

In the above example ,
- the demo1 and demo3 class contains main method hence they are eligible for execution
- the class demo 2 doesn't contain mean method, hence it is not eligible for execution. 

## Functional programing vs Object-Oriented
### Problem Statement
price is 50. and qty is 10, give solution to find the total price.  
<b> In functional programming</b>  
double findTotalPrice(double price , int qty ){  
double tot_price=price*qty;  
return tot_price;  
}  
<b> In Object oriented programming</b>  
we need to know price of what
price is 50, when for whom the price is 50 and that who is known as Entity and the price is known as its Attribute and 50,0 will be its value
