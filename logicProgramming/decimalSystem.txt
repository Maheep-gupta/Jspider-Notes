there are 3 types of number system in programming
1. Octa Decimal
2. Hexa decimal 
3. Binary 

To write these in java we provide some prefix and they are 
1.0 -- Octa
2.0x -- Hexa
3.0b -- Binary

e.g
int octa=0100; //output will be 64
int Hexa=0x10; // output will be 16
int Binary=0b100; // output will be 4
